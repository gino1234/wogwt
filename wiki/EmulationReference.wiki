In order to emulate these classes they have to be rewritten completely.  Then these new classes are translated to Javascript and used on the client/browser.  The server code continues to use the standard classes, not the emulated versions.  However, since there are two implementations of the classes, behavior may differ; if you encounter problems, please file a bug report.
