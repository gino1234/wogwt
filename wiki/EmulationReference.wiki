#summary The following standard WO classes are emulated and can be used in client code (i.e. in the browser).
#labels Featured,Phase-Implementation

  * NSArray
  * NSMutableArray
  * NSDictionary
  * NSMutableDictionary
  * NSTimestamp
  * NSRange
  * NSKeyValueCoding

  * BigDecimal (via the 3rd-party gwt-math library)

In order to emulate these classes they have to be rewritten completely.  Then these new classes are translated to Javascript and used on the client/browser.  The server code continues to use the standard classes, not the emulated versions.  However, since there are two implementations of the classes, behavior may differ; if you encounter problems, please file a bug report.
